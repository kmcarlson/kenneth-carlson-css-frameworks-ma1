# kenneth-carlson-css-frameworks-ma1

## Goal
To practice creating page layouts using Bootstrap and Sass.

## Brief
Using Bootstrap and Sass, code the supplied design into a responsive layout.

## Level 1 Process
You can use the CDN version of Bootstrap or customise the library using the source Bootstrap Sass files.

## Level 2 Process
Use BEM to name your custom classes. Add them to the elements in addition to Bootstrapâ€™s classes since Bootstrap does not follow BEM.

## Submission

Create a repository in your GitHub account called your-name-css-frameworks-ma1, e.g. mary-smith-css-frameworks-ma1 and make sure it's public.

Add, commit and push all your code to this repo.

Submit the repo link.
